实际答案是否定的，
虽然H14和H16 的材料本身具有更高的屈服强度。
但在钎焊过程中，它们都会变得更软，退火成HO的状态。
原因在于：
钎焊炉的温度约为 700°C，铝材料钎焊之后会进行退火处理，
H14和H16钎焊以后最终的状态都是HO。

For the annealed state of the 3003 cooling plate material, will H14 or H16 result in higher strength compared to HO? 

Reply:

The actual answer is negative.
Although the materials of H14 and H16 have higher yield strength originally,
They will become softer and anneal into the HO state during the brazing process.
The reason is as follows:
The temperature of the brazing furnace is approximately 700°C. After brazing with aluminum materials, annealing treatment will be carried out,
and the final state of both H14 and H16 after brazing is HO.
