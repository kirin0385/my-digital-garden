1）冷板平面度的控制：具体需根据冷板尺寸和类型进行定义；

常规冲压冷板，
平面度控制：300*300mm以内，平面度可做到0.5（联德数据，其他供应商数据有待考察）

2）孔位偏差控制：上下盖板的错位，常规单边偏差0.5-1mm没问题，具体情况具体分析；

3）孔位周围耐电压控制：常规孔位周围30mm不做耐电压检测
4. Flatness of the cooling plate, control of hole position deviation, control of the withstand voltage around the hole position 
Reply:
5) Control of the flatness of the cooling plate:
This should be defined specifically based on the size and type of the cooling plate; 
Common stamping cooling plate,
Flatness control: within 300*300mm, flatness can reach 0.5 
6) Hole position deviation control:
The misalignment between the upper and lower cover plates is within a range of 0.5 - 1mm for a single side. 
The specific project should be analyzed again. 
7) Voltage resistance control around the hole positions:
For the 30mm area around the hole positions, no voltage resistance tests are conducted.
